# Kivy Lightning ATM
This is a Lightning ATM based on Kivy language. Therefore you can use nearly every screen.
The project is based and inspired by the Lightning ATM by 21isenough. Have a look at his github-page: [21isenough - Github](https://github.com/21isenough/LightningATM)

Everything in this code is highly documented, so check out the notes first.

# Hardware
Stepup Converter
*  to power the CoinAcceptor with the RaspberryPi
*  coin acceptor takes 12V
*  RaspberryPi delivers 5V
*  Stepup Converter takes 5V and delivers 12V
*  [Step Up Converter](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07MKGN6M4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

RaspberryPi
* it works on a RaspberryPi 3b+ 2015 Model --> 2017 Model crashes while coins are inserted due to a not sufficiant power supply --> Further Tests have to be made for different models
* to run the app
* if you have a sufficiant power device you don't need the complete kit

SD-Card
* if you don't have one and didn't order it through the RaspberryPi kit
* [SD-Card](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B073JWXGNT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Jumper Wire
* to connect the devices
* female - female, female - male, male - male
* [Jumper Wire](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01EV70C78/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Flexcable for RaspberryPi Camera
* I also ordered an additional flex cable, because the default one is very short
* [Flex Cable](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01N5RS4R2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Raspberry Pi V2.1 Camera
* please also look in the FAQ-section because there are some issues with the V2.1 regarding the focus
* [RaspberryPi Camerea V2.1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01ER2SKFS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Any Screen
* a HDMI cable is necessary
* if you use a RaspberryPi 4 you need a micro HDMI cable or adapter
* also look for a proper power supply

CoinAcceptor
* I used the model 616 for this
* it's easy to set up and works properly
* [CoinAcceptor](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07DKBF1ZV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Buttons for future usage
* used to navigate through the menu

# Hardware Setup

![inside view](media/insideview.jpg)

# Software
Raspbian Image
* [Raspbian Buster with desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
* I'm not shure if the desktop version is really necessary
* if you want to know more about your pin numbers, you can simply enter the following in the command prompt
    ```sh
    $ pinout
    ```
    ![pinout](media/pinout.png)

Kivy environment
* I used the installation guide for RaspberryPi
* check if you have the correct python version for kivy
* [Installation tutorial](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-rpi.html)

Libraries
* zbarlight == 3.0
* qrcode == 6.1
* install both of them with 
```sh
$ pip3 install -r "libraries.txt"
```

RaspberryPi Camera
* you have to activate your camera in 
    ```sh
    $ sudo raspi-config
    ```
    - Interfaces
    - Camera

BTCPAY-Server
* at the moment you need a btcpay-server because you can access the rest api really easy
* [BTCPAY-Server Deployment](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/deployment)
* you also need the admin macaroon which you can also access very easy
* paste your credentials into the shared_values file
* you find your credentials as follows
-- Sever settings
-- Services
-- LND (REST server) - See Information
-- More details... by clicking here
-- take the REST Uri --> paste into shared_values --> '.../lnd-rest/btc/v1'
-- take the AdminMacaroon --> paste into shared_values --> it should be in hex format

# FAQ

##### Why I can't scan qr-codes?
The RaspberryPi camera has some known focus and resolution issues. To fix them you can do the following:
* a update is needed for full resolution
    ```sh 
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake
    $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland.git
    $ cd userland
    $ ./buildme
    ```
    after it a kernel update is necessary
    ```sh
    $ sudo rpi-update
    ```
* You have to manually focus your camera, which is         really easy, if you are extremly carefull

    ![fixing camera focus](media/fixingcamerafocus.png)
    
    Take something sharp like a pencil or your fingernail and try to turn the lense circa a quarter to the left or to the right.
    You can use the nipples on the lense
    Check your improvement by using the qr-test-code
    Be very careful and do not overtwist the lense holder. The distance to the smartphone is approximately 10cm

# Run

1. download raspbian and set it up
2. acitvate your camera in the raspi-config
3. download and install kivy - replace 'python' with 'python3' ! and be patient
4. fix your camera settings
    ```sh 
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake
    $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland.git
    $ cd userland
    $ ./buildme
    ```
    after it a kernel update is necessary
    ```sh
    $ sudo rpi-update
    ```
5. download all the Kivy Lightning ATM files
6. install the libraries.txt
    ```sh
    $ pip3 install -r "libraries.txt"
    ```
If you have done everthing correctly, download the files from Github, go to the directory and start the Kivy Lightning ATM with
```sh
$ python3 app.py
```
# TO DO
* LNURL integration
* raspiblitz integration
* raspibolt integration
* cleaner code
