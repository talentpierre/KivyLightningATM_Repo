# Kivy Lightning ATM
This is a Lightning ATM based on Kivy language. Therefore you can use the screen as touchscreen.
The project is based and inspired by the Lightning ATM by 21isenough. Have a look at his github-page: [21isenough - Github](https://github.com/21isenough/LightningATM)

Everything in this code is highly documented, so check out the notes first.

Raspberry Pi Touchscreen
* I used 7", other screens are currently not tested
* also look for a proper power supply

CoinAcceptor
* I used the model 616 for this
* it's easy to set up and works properly

# Hardware Setup

![inside view](media/insideview.jpg)

# Software
Raspbian Image
* [Raspbian Buster with desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
* I'm not shure if the desktop version is really necessary
* if you want to know more about your pin numbers, you can simply enter the following in the command prompt
    ```sh
    $ pinout
    ```
    ![pinout](media/pinout.png)

Kivy environment
* I used the installation guide for RaspberryPi
* check if you have the correct python version for kivy
* [Installation tutorial](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-rpi.html)

Libraries
* zbarlight == 3.0
* qrcode == 6.1
* install both of them with 
```sh
$ pip3 install -r "libraries.txt"
```

RaspberryPi Camera
* you have to activate your camera in 
    ```sh
    $ sudo raspi-config
    ```
    - Interfaces
    - Camera

BTCPAY-Server
* at the moment you need a btcpay-server because you can access the rest api really easy
* [BTCPAY-Server Deployment](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment/deployment)
* you also need the admin macaroon which you can also access very easy
* paste your credentials into the shared_values file
* you find your credentials as follows
-- Sever settings
-- Services
-- LND (REST server) - See Information
-- More details... by clicking here
-- take the REST Uri --> paste into shared_values --> '.../lnd-rest/btc/v1'
-- take the AdminMacaroon --> paste into shared_values --> it should be in hex format

# FAQ

##### Why I can't scan qr-codes?
The RaspberryPi camera has some known focus and resolution issues. To fix them you can do the following:
* a update is needed for full resolution
    ```sh 
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake
    $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland.git
    $ cd userland
    $ ./buildme
    ```
    after it a kernel update is necessary
    ```sh
    $ sudo rpi-update
    ```
* You have to manually focus your camera, which is         really easy, if you are extremly carefull

    ![fixing camera focus](media/fixingcamerafocus.png)
    
    Take something sharp like a pencil or your fingernail and try to turn the lense circa a quarter to the left or to the right.
    You can use the nipples on the lense
    Check your improvement by using the qr-test-code
    Be very careful and do not overtwist the lense holder. The distance to the smartphone is approximately 10cm

# Run

1. download raspbian and set it up
2. if you start your touchscreen for the first time and your screen is upside down, do the following:
    ```sh
    $ sudo nano /boot/config.txt
    ```
    - write in the first line: ```lcd_rotate=2```
    - save, exit and reboot
    
3. acitvate your camera in the raspi-config
4. download and install kivy - replace 'python' with 'python3' ! and be patient
5. fix your camera settings
    ```sh 
    $ sudo apt-get install cmake
    $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland.git
    $ cd userland
    $ ./buildme
    ```
    after it a kernel update is necessary
    ```sh
    $ sudo rpi-update
    ```
6. download all the Kivy Lightning ATM files
7. install the libraries.txt
    ```sh
    $ pip3 install -r "libraries.txt"
    ```
If you have done everthing correctly, download the files from Github, go to the directory and start the Kivy Lightning ATM with
```sh
$ python3 app.py
```
# TO DO
* LNURL integration
* raspiblitz integration
* raspibolt integration
* cleaner code
